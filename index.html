    <h1>Breath of the Wild (Wii U)</h1>
        <p>Breath of the Wild is, without a doubt, my new favorite game of all time. Far above the
            games I've played that involve time travel (Chrono Trigger), games that evoked emotional
            depths that I didn't expect from a video game (Final Fantasy 3 and 7, I wept like a baby),
            and any other Zelda games before it (Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask....frickin amazing).
            Yes, it's THAT GOOD.

        <p>Breath of the Wild is, without a doubt, my new favorite game of all time. Far above the
            games I've played that involve time travel (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>), games that evoked emotional
            depths that I didn't expect from a video game (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI">Final Fantasy 6</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII">Final Fantasy 7</a>, I wept like a baby),
            and any other Zelda games before it (Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask....frickin amazing).
            If you don't know about either of those games yet, be sure to click the links above so you
            aren't missing out. The point is this: Breath of the Wild is <b>THAT GOOD</b>.
        </p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>The best games out there have the unique ability to grab your curiousity with something small.
            You wake up in a dark room on a weird stone slab wearing only a pair of boxers. 
            </br>

            <br />
            <p>The game then gives you a simple pair of trousers and a shirt. Eventually, you're lead to a small pillar, 
            which allows you to exit the room you're in. From there, you run out to the edge of a cliff and 
            are greeted with this:

            <p>
                And that's just the first 20 minutes! You're then allowed free reign to do what you want, 
                however you are at the edge of a cliff, so you look around, and oh, there's a path there! 
                Already this game is guiding you without needing lengthy tutorials led by fairies. Zelda 
                games have been really great about this autonomus learning styyle of gameplay, but in this game 
                they've taken it to another level. You could jump off that first cliff, but it's pretty high, 
                and you only have three hearts. On your way there, you're greeted by a guy who gives you vague 
                clues as to what you should do next, but it really is up to you. You dont really have any 
                weapons or gear, so you're setting up objectives on your own, and the best part is that it really 
                feels like an adventure, youre not being told what to do but you don't feel completely lost, either.
            </p>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>The best way to describe the music of this game is &quot;minimal, but effective.&quot; In the open world you mostly
            hear the sounds of the land, the grass rustling from the wind, your own footsteps, your own grunts of 
            effort as you jump and climb, the wings of a bird flapping as it flies away. An occasional trill of piano accentuates
            these sounds of the open world, and it's incredibly soothing. Another thing I truly love is that the opening
            credits have a very <i>distinct</i> Japanese feel, which can be heard here (skip to 1:04):

        </p>
        <h2>Shrines</h2
        <p>Shrines are a key part of Breath of the Wild, where you'll find treasure, 1 on 1 battles with ancient
            robots, and items called &quot;spirit orbs,&quot; your prize for completing the shrine and will help you increase your life and stamina, with the
            latter required for things like running and scaling cliffs. This game boasts an impressive 120 Shrines, 
            most of which will test your puzzle solving skills, giving you hints as to what to do after entering through
            clever names:

            <img src="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda16/Shrines/Tah-Muhl/Tah-Muhl-Shrine.jpg">
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a05P0Kyai-QlT2-DWjWhX-yvYRE=/0x0:1280x720/1200x800/filters:focal(538x335:742x539)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53893097/Mogg_Latan_shrine__1.0.jpg">
            <br />
            Others will flat out give you treasure and its spirit orb based on the level of difficulty it took to 
            simply reach the shrine itself. These usually have the word "blessing" in their name, a welcome sight upon
            entering since yeah, it takes some doing to access the shrine, and the kind of effort varies upon location. 
            None of it feels forced, like the game is just throwing shrines together to extend the time it takes to complete
            the game. The fact that it's not required to complete ANY of these shrines in order to beat the game adds to this,
            which actually brings me to my next subject:

            <h2>Breath of the Wild takes the Best of the Best Games</h2>
                <p> I love the following games for so many reasons, but the ones below are in the top 3 reasons why.
                     Breath of the Wild took elements from all these games and worked them in effortlessly:
                     <br />
                    <ul>Chrono Trigger: Multiple Ways to Beat the Game</ul>
                    <ul>Fallout 3 &amp; 4, Skyrim, DragonAge: Open World Exploration</ul>
                    <ul>Portal: Quick and Dirty Puzzle Solving</ul>
                    <ul>Cooking Mama: Cooking! (duh)</ul> 
                    <br />
                    I won't dive into cooking in this game, but for a person who loves to cook and games about cooking,
                    this helped me latch onto the game even more. I use the term &quot;cooking&quot; personally in terms of how it's 
                    used in the game, since it's almost always literally throwing stuff into a pot and watching it spit out
                     an amazing meal, but it's just a fun element, especially with Link humming while he watches it cook.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Fair warning, I lost hours of my life to this game, and if you love Zelda or any of the other games mentioned 
                    above, you will too. Enjoy!
